me encanta la m√∫sica de Disney
"This is so good!  Is there anywhere I could find the piano sheet music for the ""Let it Go"" section of the playlist?"
"It's a good video, but it's a constant repeat of the same songs. There are MANY good Disney songs that you could have included for 3 hours of entertainment. OR MORE."

"This are the cutests piano covers ever! Walt Disney created a whole new universe, and that's so inspiring, as he said, ""if you can dream it, you can do it. Always remember that this whole thing was started by a mouse"" W. D.
amazing, right?!"

Esta compila√ß√£o est√° linda! Estou encantada
"All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be

And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you

All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go

And at last I see the light

And it's like the fog has lifted

And at last I see the light

And it's like the sky is new

And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you

Now that I see you"
Great music! Is there any way we can get your sheet music?

"I have to give a thumbs down because the content is very misleading. It's not really 3 hours long! It's just a small set of songs set to loop, playing over and over again. Please don't joke like that, it feel like some cheap cop-out or scam in a way."
